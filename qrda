QRDA 
    A document format that provides a standard structure with which to report quality measure data to
    Organizations that will analyze and interpret the data.

    Three kind of QRDA files:
	I.  Single Patient Report: Individual patient-level report that contains data defined in the measure
	II. Patient List Report: Multi-patient report across a defined population that may or may not identify
		individual patient data within the summary ===>Proposed but never balloted out
	III. Calculated Report: Aggregate quality report with a result for a given population, period of time
		Each report contains calculated summary of data for one or more measures for a specified
		population of patients within a particular health system over a specified period of time.
		A QRDA III document is an aggregate quality report that contains calculated summary data for one
		more measures for a specified population of patients within a particular health system over a specified
		period of time. 
		===>Just the result; no patient data included. Contains data for one or more measures
			==>XML document (CDA-based)
 		====>Communicate data residing in health information systems that are stripped of all 
		patient identifiers, protecting patients and healthcare providers from the risks of inadvertent leakage of 
		private information.
I and III are Drafted Standards for Trial Use (DSTU). II was proposed, but never formally balloted as DSTU
QRDA I ===> Individual patient data submission, one or more measure
	==>Eligible Clinician/Eligible Professional
QRDA III ===> Provider’s aggregate data submission, a set of patients for one or more eCQMs, PI measures /improvement activities
	==>Eligible Hospital / Critical Access Hospital

PSVA: Pre-Submission Validation Application
SEVT: Submission Engine Validation Tools

    Three level of templates
	I.   Document-level template
	II.  Section-level template
	III. Entry-level template

What is the difference between QRDA Category I and Category III reports?

A: QRDA Category I reports contain quality data for an individual patient. QRDA Category III reports contain aggregated summary quality data for a specified population within a health system. Category III report data is aggregated from individual Category I reports. ===> For hospital reporting, only QRDA I is accepted. Eligible professional and eligible clinicians only submit using QRDA III.

    QRDA framework
	Measure Section: information about the measure or measures being reported
	Reporting Parameter Section: information about the reporting time interval, and may contain other
		information that provides context for the patient data being reported
	Patient Data Section: all the patient elements expected in the measures stated in the measure 
		measure section.

	QDM to QRDA Mapping Table

At the very least, the QRDA should include:
    All data elements that confirm IPP inclusion for each referenced eMeasure (since by definition, the 			patient has met IPP criteria for each referenced eMeasure)
Smoking gun data that offers confirmatory proof, where a patient has met a criterion
All relevant data elements present in the EHR For disjunctive criteria (e.g., where a criterion can be satisfied by either of two data elements), include all the relevant data elements that are present in the EHR
Stratification variables, supplemental data elements, risk adjustment variables, and any other data element specified in the referenced eMeasure(s)
QDM breaks a concept down into a "Quality Data Type", "Quality Data Attributes", and a "Value Set". A "Quality Data Element" is a Quality Data Type, along with its Quality Data Attributes and associated value set. Quality Data Types (e.g., Medication Administered, Diagnosis Active) represent a clinical category (e.g., Medication, Diagnosis) coupled with a "state" (e.g., Administered, Active). Quality Data Attributes represent various components of the Quality Data Type, such as timing, or category-specific characteristics

Quality Data Types are converted into RIM-derived XML patterns that, when coupled with value sets, become Quality Data Elements that can be used as data criteria within a QDM-based eMeasure. Each Quality Data Type pattern is assigned a unique ID, which is present in the eMeasure, and which is mapped to a corresponding CDA template. A Quality Data Element further constrains a Quality Data Type pattern via vocabulary binding to a value set. The linked CDA template can be further constrained through a corresponding value set binding. This allows one to automatically construct a QDM-based QRDA, given a QDM-based eMeasure.

The further constraint on a CDA template through value set binding results in a new CDA template. To retain flexibility in defining new QDM-based eMeasures without the need to update this guide, we introduce the notion of “dynamic CDA template creation”. The actual CDA template ID in a QRDA instance contains the templateId from the library (in templateId/@root), dynamically concatenated with the value set id from the eMeasure (in templateId/@extension).

RecordTarget
The recordTarget records the patient whose health information is described by the clinical document; it must contain at least one patientRole element
	patientRole ->id, adds, telecom
	patient->name(US pattern)->administrativeGenderCode->birthTime->maritalStatus
	may contains: 
		->religiousAffiliationCode, raceCode, stdc:raceCode, ethnicGroupCode
		->guardian->Personal Relationship Role Type->addr->telecom->guardianPerson->name
		->birthplace->addr->state->postal code->country
		->languageCommunication->languageCode->modeCode
			->proficiencyLevelCode->preferenceInd
	ProviderOrganization
		->providerOrganization->id, name,telecom, addr,
	RecordTarget value sets
		HP: primary home, WP: work place, MC: mobile contact, HV: vacation home
	Administrative Gender (HL7) value set:
		F: female, M: male, UN: undifferentiated
	Marital Status Value Set
		A: annulled, D: divorced, I: interlocutory, L: legally separated, M: married, P: polygamous
		S: never married, T: domestic partner, W: widowed

Author:
	The author element represents the creator of the clinical document, a device, or a person
	->author->time->assignedAuthor->id, code,addr,telecom, assignedPerson | assignedAutoringDevice
	->US RealmPerson Name | manufactureModelName ->softwareName
DataEnterer
The dataEnterer element represents the person who transferred the content, written or dictated by someone else, into the clinical document. The guiding rule of thumb is that an author provides the content found within the header or body of the document, subject to their own interpretation, and the dataEnterer adds that information to the electronic system. In other words, a dataEnterer transfers information from one source to another (e.g., transcription from paper form to electronic system).
-> dataEnterer->assignedEntity->id, code, addr, telecom ->assignedPerson->name, id
Custodian 
The custodian element represents the organization that is in charge of maintaining the document. The custodian is the steward that is entrusted with the care of the document. Every CDA document has exactly one custodian. The custodian participation satisfies the CDA definition of Stewardship.
LegalAuthenticator 
The legalAuthenticator identifies the single person legally responsible for the document and must be present if the document has been legally authenticated.
Authenticator 
The authenticator identifies a participant or participants who attested to the accuracy of the information in the document.
Participant: 
The participant element identifies other supporting participants, including parents, relatives, caregivers, insurance policyholders, guarantors, and other participants related in some way to the patient.


CDA Document Structure
    Header: Metadata about the document
	-who created the document
	-who is the document about
	-when was the document create
	-where was the document created
	-etc
    Body: Human-Readable representation of the document either xml or nonXML format
	If xml, it will contain XML encoded sections of text with rendering instances referred to
	as the narrative Block.
    Entity: fully structured and machine-processable representation of an item on the CDA
    Types: vital sign, laboratory and allergy observations, substance administration, clinical
	Procedure, etc.
	If presented, the same data must also be in a narrative block

Verbs 
shall: an absolute requirement for the particular element. Where a SHALL constraint is applied to an XML element, that element must be present in an instance, but may have an exceptional value (i.e., may have a nullFlavor), unless explicitly precluded. Where a SHALL constraint is applied to an XML attribute, that attribute must be present, and must contain a conformant value.
shall not: an absolute prohibition against inclusion
should/should not: best practice or recommendation. There may be valid reasons to ignore an item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course
may/need not: truly optional; can be included or omitted as the author decides with no implications
Cardinality
0..1 zero or one
1..1 exactly one
1..* at least one
0..* zero or more
1..n at least one and not more than n

Null Flavor
	NI No information. This is the most general and default null flavor. 
	NA Not applicable. Known to have no proper value (e.g., last menstrual period for a male).
	UNK Unknown. A proper value is applicable, but is not known.
	ASKU Asked but not known. Information was sought, but not found (the patient was asked but did 
		not know).
	NAV Temporarily unavailable. The information is not available, but is expected to be available later.
	NASK Not asked. The patient was not asked.
	MSK	There is information on this item available but it has not been provided by the sender due to 
		security, privacy, or other reasons. There may be an alternate mechanism for gaining access to 
		this information.
	OTH	The actual value is not and will not be assigned a standard coded value. An example is the 
		name or identifier of a clinical trial.
