Introduction
------------
Network: a collection of computer and devices connected to each other
Distributed System: a software that runs over a computer network and
    provides a cohesive structure that enable transparent access to resource
P2P: Peer-to-Peer, no central server,
    Each client can function as client and server at the same time
    No central storage or authentication
    Installed at homes or very small bussiness
    Inexpensive but offer almost no security
PAN: Personal Area Network
BAN: Body Area Network
LAN: Local Area Network
CAN: Campus Area Network
MAN: Metropolitan Area Network
WAN: Wide Area Network
ISP: Internet Service Provider
End-to-End Delay: Transmission delay, propagation delay, queueing delay,
    receiver processing delay
RFC: Request for Comment
SAP: Service Access Point
CSMA: Carrier Sense Multiple Access

-------------------------------
Data Link Layer//Physical Layer
-------------------------------s
CRC: Cyclic Redundancy Check
Sliding Window Protocol
PPP: Point-to-Point Protocol
CSMA/CD: Carrier Sense Multiple Access, Collision Detector
CSMA/CA: Carrier Sense Multiple Access, Collision Avoidance
CDMA: Code Division Multiple Access
GEO/LEO/MEO Satellite

-------------
Network Layer
-------------
ARPANET:
Virtual Circuit Network and Datagram Network
Host Intelligence vs Router Intelligence
DAG: Directed Acyclic Graph
Broadcasting: send message to all nodes in the network
Flooding: forward the frame to all ports in the lookup table except the
    one that it came
Reaction to Good News vs Reaction to Bad News
QoS: Quality of Service
MTU: Maximum Transmission Unit
IP: Internet Protocol
    v4: 4 bytes, 32 bits
    v6: 16 bytes, 128 bits
VPN: Virtual Private Network

--------------
Transport Layer
---------------
SCTP: Stream Control Transmission Protocol
SST: Structured Stream Transport
TSAP: Transport Service Access Point
NASP: Network Service Access Point
Congestion: network not fast enough; Flow control: receiver slow
UDP: User Datagram Protocol, 8 bytes header, 65515 bytes payload
RPC: Remote Procedure Call, call procedure in remote host
RTP: Realtime Transport Protocol
TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
Silly Window Syndrome: data passed is large block but receiver reads 1
    the data 1 byte at a time
Broadcast Storm: one broadcast triggers another.
Long Fat Network: network with high bandwidth and high delay, store much
    information inside the network.
DTN: Delayed Tolerant Network, store messages inside network until
     they can be delivered


-----------------
Application Layer
-----------------
DNS: Domain Name System
Cybersquatting: buying a domain name just to sell it to an interested party for a   
                higher price
Name Resolution: look up the IP address corresponding to a given hostname
SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (No authentication, ASCII char, clear message)
ESMTP: Extended SMTP
MIME: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension
POP3: Post Office Protocol, v3
IMAP: Internet Message Access Protocol, v4
WWW: The World Wide Web, a.k.a, the web, 1989.
    1991: Tim-Berners_Lee presented the web of linked documents.
    1993: Marc Andreessen at University of Illinois developed and released
        Mosaic -- the first graphical browser.
    1990s: browser war between Netscape and Internet Explorer
    1990s and 2000s: millions of website and billions of pages
        Amazon==>1994
        Ebay==>1995
        Google==>1998
CERN: the European Center for Nuclear Research
URL: Uniform Resource Locator
    protocol==>https, http, ftp, etc
    server==>xxx.yyy.com, etc
    path==>/aaa/bbb
    file==>assf
Static Web Page: simple files, same content for every viewing
Dynamic Web Page: generated by the programs running on the server
        (with a database)
AJAX: Asynchronous Javascript And Xml
HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language
DOM: Document Object Model
XML: Extensible Markup Language
HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol
    100==>Server agrees to handle the client request (Information)
    200==>Request succeeded, 204==>no content present (Success)
    301==>Page moved, 304==>Cached pages still valid(Redirection)
    403==>Forbidden page; 404==>Page not found (Client error)
    500==>Internal Server Error, 503==>Try again later (Server Error)
SIP: Session Initial Protocol
